# 🧠 NeetCode Practice for AI Fellowship

This repository documents my progress solving **NeetCode problems** as preparation for an AI fellowship.  
My goal is to complete **5 problems every week**, track my solutions, and reflect on what I learn along the way.  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills in **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
- Build consistency with **5 problems per week**  
- Track patterns and approaches useful for **technical interviews & AI-related coding**  
- Share progress and insights publicly for accountability  

---


## 📚 Topics to Cover (NeetCode Categories)
- Arrays & Hashing  
- Two Pointers  
- Sliding Window  
- Stack  
- Binary Search  
- Linked List  
- Trees  
- Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  

---

## 📝 Format
Each solution will include:
1. **Problem link** (from NeetCode/LeetCode)  
2. **Code implementation**  
3. **Time & space complexity analysis**  
4. **Reflection** (what I learned, mistakes made, alternative approaches)  

---

## ✅ Example Entry
**Problem:** [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)  
**Solution:** [View Code](./week2/ContainsDuplicate.js)  
**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space  
**Reflection:** Learned how to use a `Set` for quick duplicate detection instead of nested loops.

## 🔥 Motivation
> *"5 problems a week → 20 problems a month → 240 problems a year. Consistency compounds."*  

This repo will serve as my logbook as I sharpen my problem-solving skills on the path toward an AI fellowship.
